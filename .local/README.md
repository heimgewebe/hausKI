# `.local/`

This directory holds machine-specific caches and helper outputs that should not
be committed. Keeping the README checked in documents the intent while ensuring
Git preserves the folder structure.

Typical examples include downloaded datasets, temporary CLI captures, or other
artifacts generated during runbook execution. If you introduce new tooling that
relies on `.local/`, feel free to document the expected contents here.
