# Trust weighting SPECIFICATION for decision-making
#
# ⚠️ STATUS: This file is a SPECIFICATION, not loaded at runtime.
# The values below are mirrored in the Rust code (crates/indexd/src/lib.rs).
# Source of Truth: Rust hardcodes (until policy-loading implementation).
# Roadmap: Dynamic loading from this file is planned for a future release.
#
# Each trust level has a weight multiplier (0.0 - 1.0)
# Applied to search scores to prioritize trusted sources

trust_weights:
  high: 1.0    # Chronik events, verified internal sources
  medium: 0.7  # OS context, application logs
  low: 0.3     # External sources, user input, tool output

# Optional: minimum weight to prevent complete suppression
# If not specified, weights can go to 0.0
min_weight: 0.1
